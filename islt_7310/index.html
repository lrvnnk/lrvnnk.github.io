            <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio, an interactive view into my educational and professional background. My name is Lukas Veinbergs and I am pursuing a M.S. in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri - Columbia and expect to graduate in August of 2021. In this digital portfolio I hope to give an accurate depiction of myself as a student as well as a person and leader. This portfolio will give you an insight into my academic career, work and volunteer opportunities I participated in during my time as an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Missouri.
