        Reflection on my Experiences
    </h2>
    <main id="rfmain">
    <p>My experience in web design and development is growing daily. By the end of my degree
        program I will have all the skills to create web pages and web applications from start to finish. My experiences within my degree program have proved to be invaluable in learning my skills. Weekly assignments along with overarching projects have allowed me to understand how to multitask as well as how to stay ahead of schedule.</p>
            <p class="second">I plan on using the skills I have learned in my degree program to smoothly integrate into whatever organization I end up working for. My undergraduate background in communications adds to my graduate coursework by giving me the proper teamwork and leadership skills necessary to be an effective and productive employee. I fully expect to be a leading employee in my future company, taking charge in group projects as well as excelling in my individual work. The combination of communications and learning technologies and design make me a valuable candidate for many jobs in the field of web design and development.
