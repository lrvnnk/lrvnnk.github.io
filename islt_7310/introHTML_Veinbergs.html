    Hello, my name is Lukas Veinbergs and I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Missouri. I received my B.A. in Communications from the University of Missouri this past May and have been looking forward to beginning my graduate courses ever since. I have minimal prior web development experience but am looking forward to challenging myself in this new arena. I hope to use the information learned in this course to aid me in further courses as well as prepare me for a career in the field of web design and development. Currently my favorite hobbies include fishing and playing baseball. I have been given the unique opportunity to pursue my master’s degree while competing for the University of Missouri’s varsity baseball team and couldn’t be more excited about it. I am looking forward to moving through this course and am excited to enhance my understanding of web design and development.
